<!-- Text Formatting
. **Note that you may see some fancy autocomplete actions in this video**. These are accomplished
through keyboard shortcuts that have already been set up! To get the most comprehensive
autocomplete functionality, consider using a Sublime "package", which is basically what
Sublime calls extensions. The most authoritative source of packages for Sublime is
[Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/). You'll first want to make sure you install
Package Control correctly by following [these instructions](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)
, and then you can easily grab any of the packages on that site directly within Sublime! [Emmet]
(https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Emmet) is a very popular autocomplete package and will probably
 suit your needs. With great power comes great responsibility. Many packages can and will slow S
 ublime down, so take care to only enable the ones you truly need to keep Sublime running at
 prime speed. -->

<!--
foldername/ = go inside the folder
filename = use a file in the current folder
.../ = leave the current folder and go up to the parent folder/directory
The .../ won't work here b/c the images folder is not OUTSIDE of the website-1 folder.
It would begin looking for an images folder outside of the website-1 folder
.../.../ would leave the DEV folder
.../.../.../ would leave the USER folder
.../.../.../.../ would put you in the main users folder

<!-- Alt attribute does two things:

For people who are visually impaired and are using screen readers, the alt text will be read aloud to them.
Search engines can't see images, but they can see alt text.

The alt text here describes the picture.

title attribute makes a caption appear when a mouse hovers above an image.
