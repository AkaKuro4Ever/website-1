<!-- a stands for anchor, but think of it as standing for action, linking to some other page.
it tells the browser where we want the link to go to.
Between the two tags is the actual linkable content you click on.

All these links are internal, using relative paths - the file name - because they're in the same folder.
If you want to link to an external site, it's about the same, just with a url.

The full path is an absolute path. This is needed for external sites.
By default, they'll target the current page they're in.
But you can make it open a new tab instead of changing the current page
you're on with another attribute: target
